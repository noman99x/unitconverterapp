The Unit Converter App is a simple yet powerful web application built using Python and Streamlit. It allows users to convert values between different units of Length, Weight, and Time in real-time through an interactive and user-friendly interface.

The app includes:

üìè Length conversions (Kilometers ‚Üî Miles)

‚öñÔ∏è Weight conversions (Kilograms ‚Üî Pounds)

‚è±Ô∏è Time conversions (Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days)

By leveraging Streamlit's rapid web development capabilities, this app demonstrates how Python can be used to build practical tools with clean UIs and instant feedback. It helps users perform unit conversions effortlessly without needing any external software or manual calculations.

This project reflects the core idea of learning-by-doing and applying coding knowledge to solve everyday problems ‚Äî aligning perfectly with the Growth Mindset Challenge.
